Arctic Torrent v1.2.4
Copyright (c) 2004-2005 Cory Nelson

Arctic is a minimal BitTorrent client.  It wont have all the pretty features that
other clients have, but focuses on low memory and cpu usage.

Platform Support
---------------------
Arctic is tested on Windows XP and should work on 2000, XP, and 2003 in 32-bit
and 64-bit.  It will not run on Windows 9x.
